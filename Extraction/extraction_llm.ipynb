    "# Introduction\n",
    "In today's tutorial, we will explore how large language models (LLMs), particularly the models developed by OpenAI, can be instrumental in automating accounting-related workflows. By leveraging these models, accountants can process and extract information from large and unstructured documents like SEC filings with unprecedented efficiency. Let's dive in to understand how"
