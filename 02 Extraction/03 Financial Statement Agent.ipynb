    "# Financial Statement Agent: Automated Balance Sheet Validation with Azure and GPT-4\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build a **Financial Statement Agent** designed to **automate the validation** of financial balance sheets using a combination of **Azure Document Intelligence** and **GPT-4**. This agent aims to detect **discrepancies** between the provided totals and computed sums of individual items within financial statements, ensuring that assets, liabilities, and equity totals are accurately calculated and consistent with accounting principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Objectives:\n",
    "- **Extract financial data** from balance sheet documents using Azure Document Intelligence.\n",
    "- **Perform precise summation verification** for key balance sheet categories such as assets, liabilities, and equity.\n",
    "- **Validate cross-footing and footing** to ensure that the sums of individual items and totals match across years.\n",
    "- **Flag discrepancies** where provided totals do not match computed sums, and investigate potential resolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Technologies:\n",
    "1. **Azure Document Intelligence**: We use this service to extract structured financial data from PDFs or scanned images, such as balance sheets. The extracted data will be used as the basis for performing summations and validation checks.\n",
    "2. **GPT-4 (OpenAI)**: GPT-4 assists in processing and analyzing the extracted data by performing detailed **cross-footing** and **footing** operations, detecting discrepancies, and generating diagnostic reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "1. **Data Extraction**: Using Azure Document Intelligence, we extract relevant sections of balance sheets (such as current assets and liabilities) and convert the unstructured data into structured JSON format for analysis.\n",
    "2. **Validation and Error Detection**: We apply predefined rules and financial logic to ensure the **sum of individual items matches the provided totals**. This includes verifying each year’s values for accuracy and tagging mismatches as \"DISCREPANCY.\"\n",
    "   - **Cross-footing**: Ensuring the sum of items within a section equals the section total.\n",
    "   - **Footing**: Verifying that total sums in each column match the grand total.\n",
    "3. **Discrepancy Resolution**: We investigate each discrepancy found, and, if a discrepancy is detected, we attempt to identify **potential resolutions** by matching differences with other values in the balance sheet.\n",
    "4. **Diagnostic Reporting**: The final output is a **detailed diagnostic report** in Markdown format, summarizing discrepancies and referencing their locations in the balance sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Will Learn:\n",
    "- How to use **Azure's Document Intelligence** to extract and structure data from balance sheets.\n",
    "- How to implement **cross-footing and footing calculations** to verify the accuracy of balance sheet totals.\n",
    "- How to generate **automated reports** that flag errors and discrepancies in financial statements.\n",
    "- How to use **GPT-4** for intelligent summation verification and to walk through each validation step thoroughly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites:\n",
    "- Basic understanding of **financial statement structure** and **accounting principles**.\n",
    "- Familiarity with **Python** and **API-based integrations**.\n",
    "- Access to Azure Cognitive Services for using the **Document Intelligence API**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s begin by extracting and analyzing the assets section of the balance sheet, using Azure Document Intelligence to retrieve the data, followed by GPT-4 to perform summation and validation checks.\n"
